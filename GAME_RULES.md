## Play Nine — Game Rules

1. The board displays a random number of stars between 1 and 9. This is your target for the current round.
2. You have the digits 1 through 9 available as buttons. Each digit can only be used once per game.
3. Select one or more digits whose total equals the current star count.
4. While selecting, digits turn blue to indicate a “candidate” selection. If the sum exceeds the star count, candidates turn red until you deselect enough to match the target.
5. A correct combination locks in those digits, marking them as used (green) and removing them from future rounds.
6. The game immediately draws a new playable star count from the remaining digits.
7. You have 10 seconds to use every digit. When time hits zero and numbers remain, the game ends.
8. Clearing all digits before the timer expires wins the game. The time left becomes your score.
9. Scores higher than the stored high score overwrite it, so you can keep improving your best time.
10. Press **Play Again** any time to reset the board, timer, and score for another run.
