# PLAY NINE
This inâ€‘browser game using ReactJS. 

# HOW TO PLAY?
It's a simple math skills game for kids.

When it starts, the player gets a random number of stars between 1 and 9 and also the fixed set of numbers from 1 to 9. The goal is to use all nine numbers. 

For each random number of stars, the player needs to pick one or more numbers that sum to the number of stars. So for 2, I can pick 2. For 4 stars, I have 2 options. I can either pick 4 or I can pick 3 plus 1. For 9, I have 2 options here as well. I can either pick 9 directly or 4 plus 5. Now while the player is picking numbers, they get marked as candidates because it's not a complete answer. And if they pick more than the count of stars, numbers get marked as wrong, and the player can unpick these candidates or wrong numbers to be able to pick a correct sum. And the game will always draw a number of stars that is playable. 

We have timer that starts when game starts. If the timer runs out and you're not done picking all the numbers, the game is over.
